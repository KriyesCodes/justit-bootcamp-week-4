/*
Tasks:

1: Create a variable that stores your name and log a string to the console that personally greets you using template literals. 
2: Create variables storing your name, your favourite colour and your favourite film or tv series. Using template literals I want you to log a sentence including these values to the console.
3: Create variables storing what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday and log them to the console. Without redeclaring new variables I would like you to assign a new value of what you ate today to the variables, and again log them to the console.
