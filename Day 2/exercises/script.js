Declare a variable called age and write an if statement that checks whether age is 18 or above. If age is less than 18 log "Sorry, I can't serve you" to the console, if age is 18 or above log "No problem, what would you like to drink?"

3: Create a variable that stores a number. Check whether the number is divisible by 3 or 5, if so log "This number is divisible by 3 or 5" to the console. Otherwise log an alternate message to the console.

4: Create a variable that stores a number. If the number is divisible by 3, log "fizz" to the console. If the number is divisible by 5 log "buzz" to the console. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log "fizz buzz" to the console. Otherwise log the number to the console.
